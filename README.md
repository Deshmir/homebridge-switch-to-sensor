# Homebridge Platform Plugin Switch On Motion Sensor

This is a template Homebridge platform plugin that I use to bridge an action in Apple HomeKit to Alexa.

By turning on the switch the motion sensor will be triggered.  The motion sensor will return a motion while then switch is turned on.

I make the HomeKit automation turn of the switch after 1 minute.

# Google Nest to Alexa

I am using Starling Home Hub to map my Nest devices to Apple HomeKit.

By adding an action to the Nest Hello Doorbell and turn on one of these switches I thereby activate a sensor.
That sensor I can use to trigger a routine in Alexa.
